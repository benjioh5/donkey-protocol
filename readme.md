# Donkey Lending
## Description
Donkey Protocol is a multi-chain (Ethereum, Klaytn) smart contract for supplying or borrowing assets. Through the dToken contracts, accounts on the blockchain supply capital (Ether or ERC-20 tokens on Ethereum, Klay or KIP-7 tokens on Klaytn) to receive dTokens or borrow assets from the protocol (holding other assets as collateral). The dToken contracts track these balances and algorithmically set interest rates for borrowers.  

# Donkey Staking

## Description
Donkey Staking Contract allows users to stake their DON tokens for a predetermined term(lockupTerm) after which users can claim their principal with interest.  

# Donkey Governance

## Description
VDON StakingContract allows users to stake their DON tokens for a predetermined term in exchange for VDON tokens and interest (in the form of DON and ecoCNG tokens). As of Friday (11/04 KST), ownership of VDON tokens will grant users exclusive rights including but not limited to voting/submitting governance proposals and claiming a certain portion of Donkey Protocols' revenue.
In future updates, as part of an effort to promote Donkey Protocol's token economy and incentivize users to hold on to their VDON tokens, the team will be extending VDON tokens' utilities so that VDON holders can enjoy a more varied form of exclusive benefits.
